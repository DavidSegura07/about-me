## About Me

Hey there! Welcome to my personal website! This is where I'll be sharing my coding journey and all the cool stuff I've learned, not just from Code 201 but also from future courses.

From diving into the basics of coding to exploring advanced concepts, I'll be documenting my progress and experiences. You'll find insights into my coding adventures, projects I've worked on, and the new skills I've acquired.
